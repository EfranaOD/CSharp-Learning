# C# Loops  
**Folder:** 01-basics/04-conditionals-loops/02-loops  
**Description:** Practice programs covering different looping constructs (`for`, `while`, `do-while`, `foreach`, and nested loops) for iteration and repetition in code.  

---

## For Loop  
**Path:** `04-conditionals-loops/02-loops/for/`  
**Description:** Execute a block of code a fixed number of times, typically using a counter with initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.  
**Programs / Examples:**  
- Numbers from 1 to 10  
- Sum of numbers from 1 to N  
- Multiplication table of 5  
- Reverse counting (10 to 1)  

---

## While Loop  
**Path:** `04-conditionals-loops/02-loops/while/`  
**Description:** Repeatedly execute a block of code as long as the condition remains `true`.  
**Programs / Examples:**  
- Print numbers from 1 to 10  
- Sum of digits of a number  
- Guess the secret number  
- Factorial of a number  

---

## Do-While Loop  
**Path:** `04-conditionals-loops/02-loops/do-while/`  
**Description:** Execute the block of code **at least once**, then continue repeating as long as the condition remains `true`.  
**Programs / Examples:**  
- Keep printing numbers until the user enters `0`  
- Password validation (repeat until correct)  
- Menu-driven program (Say Hello, Show Date, Exit)  

---

## Foreach Loop  
**Path:** `04-conditionals-loops/02-loops/foreach/`  
**Description:** Iterate directly over collections (arrays, strings, lists, etc.) without using an index.  
**Programs / Examples:**  
- Print all elements of an integer array  
- Count vowels in a string  
- Calculate the sum of elements in an array  
- Find the largest number in an array  

---

## Nested Loops  
**Path:** `04-conditionals-loops/02-loops/nested-loops/`  
**Description:** Use loops inside other loops to create patterns or work with grids/tables.  
**Programs / Examples:**  
- Square grid of numbers  
- Right-angled triangle of stars  
- Multiplication table (1 to 5)  

---

## Pattern Generator Project
**Path:** `04-conditionals-loops/02-loops/pattern-generator/` 
**Description:** A menu-driven console application to generate various patterns using loops (`for`, `nested for`, `do-while`). Users select a pattern and specify size or height.

**Features:**
- Square Grid
- Right-Angled Triangle
- Multiplication Table
- Pyramid of Stars
- Filled Hourglass
- Hollow Hourglass
- Filled Butterfly
- Hollow Butterfly
- Exit option

**Highlights:**
- Nested loops for row/column iteration
- Input validation with `int.TryParse`
- Dynamic patterns based on user input
- Colored console output for visual appeal
- Menu repeatedly displays using `do-while` until exit

**Showcase:**  
Demonstrates mastery of loops, nested loops, menu-driven programming, and dynamic pattern generation in C#. Ideal as a portfolio project.
