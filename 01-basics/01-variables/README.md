## Structure
- **practice/** – Raw practice code for understanding and experimenting with variables.
- **assignments/** – Self-completed tasks to apply concepts.
- **challenges/** – Advanced variable-related challenges exploring shadowing, const, readonly, dynamic, var, and variable scope.

## Assignments
1. **swapping-variables/** – Swap two variables without using a temporary variable.
2. **reassign-variables/** – Predict and understand tricky variable reassignment cases.
3. **rotate-three-variablevalues/** – Rotate three variable values clockwise without using temporary variables.
4. **swap-string/** – Swap two strings without a temporary variable.
5. **scope-variable/** – Demonstrate variable scope, reassignment, and related behaviors.

## Challenges (in challenges/)
- Shadow Hunt: Demonstrates const, readonly, and variable shadowing.
- Dynamic Calculator: Uses dynamic typing for arithmetic operations with runtime type conversion.
- Constant Conversion Table: Prints a formatted inches-to-centimeters conversion table using constants and string interpolation.
- Shadowing in Loops: Explores field vs local variable shadowing inside loops.
- Dynamic Inventory Tracker: Mini-project using dynamic arrays, including add, remove, search, and shadowing demonstration.
- Readonly Rules Simulation: Simulates game settings with const, readonly fields, pause/resume logic, and elapsed time tracking.
