# C# Operators
**Folder:** 01-basics/03-operators  
**Description:** Practice programs covering all C# operators from Arithmetic to Bitwise.

---

## Arithmetic Operators  
**Path:** `03-operators/arithmetic-operators/`  
**Description:** Perform basic mathematical calculations with user input.  
**Programs / Examples:**  
- Sum, Difference, Product, Quotient, and Remainder of two integers  
- Division with double inputs  
- Even/Odd check using modulus `%`  

---

## Relational Operators  
**Path:** `03-operators/relational-operators/`  
**Description:** Compare values and relationships between operands (`==, !=, <, >, <=, >=`).  
**Programs / Examples:**  
- Compare two numbers with all relational operators  
- Age eligibility check using `>=`  
- String equality check (case-sensitive)  
- Multi-type comparison (int, double, string, mixed)  

---

## Logical Operators  
**Path:** `03-operators/logical-operators/`  
**Description:** Combine multiple conditions using logical operators (`&&, ||, !`).  
**Programs / Examples:**  
- Voting eligibility check using age and nationality (`&&`)  
- Discount eligibility for students or seniors (`||`)  
- Login system validation with username & password  

---

## Assignment Operators  
**Path:** `03-operators/assignment-operators/`  
**Description:** Update variable values using compound assignment operators (`=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=`).  
**Programs / Examples:**  
- Bank balance updates with deposits, withdrawals, and interest  
- String concatenation using `+=`  
- Game score challenge with multiple updates (`+=, -=, *=, /=, %=`)  

---

## Unary Operators  
**Path:** `03-operators/unary-operators/`  
**Description:** Single operand operations (`++, --, +, -, !`).  
**Programs / Examples:**  
- Counter demo with prefix and postfix increments  
- Boolean toggle with `!`  
- Positive/negative converter using unary plus and minus  
- Player energy tracker mini-game with multiple unary operations  

---

## Bitwise Operators
**Path:** `03-operators/bitwise-operators/`  
**Description:** Bit-level operations on integers (`&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>`)  
**Programs / Examples:**
- AND, OR, XOR
- Bitwise NOT (`~`)
- Left shift (`<<`) and Right shift (`>>`)
