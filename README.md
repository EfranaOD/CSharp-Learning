# CSharp-Learning
This repository is my personal journey of learning **C# step by step**.  

It is organized in phases:
- **01-basics** → Core C# fundamentals
- **02-midlevel**
- **03-intermediate**
- **04-advanced**
- **05-professional**
- **projects** → Mini and major projects to apply learning

My focus is on practicing consistently and tracking progress publicly.
