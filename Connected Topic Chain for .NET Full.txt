Connected Topic Chain for .NET Full Stack (2 Months)
Phase 1 — Core C# Foundations (Week 1–2)
We start with building blocks that naturally stack:

Variables & Data Types →

Operators (use variables in expressions) →

Conditional Statements (use variables + operators) →

Loops (use variables + conditions repeatedly) →

Methods (organize all above into reusable code) →

Arrays (pass into methods, loop through) →

Strings (manipulation inside methods) →

Structs & Enums (store structured data, combine with arrays/methods) →

Classes & Objects (replace structs, begin OOP) →

Properties & Constructors (initialize & control access) →

Inheritance (extend classes from earlier topics) →

Polymorphism & Interfaces (swap behaviors dynamically).

Every topic’s practice will require using all previous topics.
For example: in “Inheritance,” you’ll use variables, loops, arrays, methods, etc., from earlier days.

Phase 2 — C# for Real Applications (Week 3–4)
Here we bridge to data and real-world scenarios:
13. Collections (List, Dictionary, etc.) → store objects from Phase 1.
14. LINQ Basics → query collections from above.
15. Exception Handling → wrap all previous code safely.
16. File I/O → save and load data from disk.
17. Intro to SQL → same concepts, but in a database.
18. ADO.NET → connect your C# programs to SQL DB.
19. Entity Framework Core Basics → ORM for easier DB access.
20. EF Core Relationships → multiple tables, foreign keys, joins.

Here, we start building mini console apps that read/write from a DB — carrying all your earlier C# + OOP skills into real-world DB operations.

Phase 3 — ASP.NET Core Full Stack (Week 5–6)
Now we bring it all to the web:
21. ASP.NET Core MVC Basics → show your DB data in a browser.
22. MVC Routing → connect URLs to methods.
23. Views & Razor Syntax → display dynamic content from models.
24. Forms & Model Binding → send data from the user to your app.
25. Validation → check user input before saving.
26. CRUD Operations with EF Core in MVC → create, read, update, delete DB records.
27. ASP.NET Core Web API Basics → expose your data as JSON.
28. Consume APIs in C# → fetch & display data from other APIs.

Phase 4 — Frontend & Deployment (Week 7–8)
Finally, polish and launch:
29. HTML & CSS Basics → style your MVC views.
30. JavaScript Basics → dynamic client-side behavior.
31. AJAX → load API data without refreshing.
32. Bootstrap → responsive design.
33. Authentication & Authorization in ASP.NET Core.
34. Publish to Azure/Hosting → get your project live.
35. Capstone Project Build → combine everything.
36. Mock Interviews & Resume Building → prepare for applications.
