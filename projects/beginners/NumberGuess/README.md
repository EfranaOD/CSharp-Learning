# 🎲 NumberGuessGame

A simple console game built using **C#**, where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number.

## ✨ Features
- Generates a **random number** within a specified range.
- Allows the user **3 attempts per game**.
- Provides **hints** if the guess is too high or too low.
- Option to **reset/play again** after each round.
- Handles **invalid input** gracefully.

## 💡 Learning Highlights
- Using **class libraries** in C# (`NumberGuessGame` in `GameUtilitiesLibrary`).
- Random number generation with `Random`.
- Input validation using `int.TryParse()` and `char.TryParse()`.
- Loop control with `for` and `do-while`.
- Writing **clean methods** (`GenerateNumber()`, `CheckGuess()`, `GetHint()`, `ResetGame()`) to structure logic.
- Console operations like `Console.Clear()` and formatted output.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **C# (.NET)**
- Console Application
