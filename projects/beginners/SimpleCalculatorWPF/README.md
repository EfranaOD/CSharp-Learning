# 🧮 Simple Calculator (WPF)

A basic calculator built using **C#** and **WPF**, focused on logic and functionality rather than UI design.

## ✨ Features
- Performs **Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division**
- Handles **decimal inputs** (only one `.` allowed per number)
- Prevents invalid keyboard input (only numbers and valid symbols)
- Tracks which `TextBox` is active using `GotFocus`
- Auto-focuses the first input box on startup

## 💡 Learning Highlights
- Event handling (`Click`, `GotFocus`)
- Input validation with `double.TryParse()`
- Working with `TextBox` focus and state
- Writing clean, functional C# logic for WPF interfaces

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **C# (.NET)**
- **WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)**
- Visual Studio 2022
